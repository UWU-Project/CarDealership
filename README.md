## INTRODUCTION

“Car Dealership Information System”, is a Command Line Based Simple Standalone Management Information System. Whereas it is converting to a fully computerized system, reducing the paperwork to close to zero. Computerization also helps organization to minimize wastage of time and space, as well as manpower. This system is more manageable and efficient, especially to manage all the data. The handling of this project is also very simple so that anyone can understand it easily.

## FEATURES

As a Solution for the Scenario, We have developed a simple Car Dealership information system. Using Data Structures and Command-line Interface.
Mainly we implemented functions to; 
1. Add Car Details 
2. Display All Car details 
3. Check latest car details
4. Filter and buy a Car
5. Delete First Car Details 
6. Delete Last Car details 
7. Filter car details and buy
 
Here, We used ADTs to solve our problem. Data types are defined by a collection of values and operations known as Abstract Data Types (ADTs). In this case, we used three ADTs, Doubly Linked List, Stack, and Hash Map which are three of the most popular data structures in computer science.

## DATA STRUCTURES

**Doubly Linked List**

Doubly linked list is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. We used this ADT to Add Car Details to the queue and to delete first car details and last car details from tail and head.

**Stack**

Stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations: Push, and Pop. We used it to Filter out the latest car details which include data in the topper of the stack.

**Hash Map**

Hash Map is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. Here it is used to store owner details of a car when purchase is happens.
This system is more manageable and efficient, especially to manage most of the Vehicle's Details.  The handling of this system is also very simple so that anyone can understand it easily.

## PSEUDO CODE

```python
PROGRAM: Login to the system
	 Display Menu
IF (add a New car details to the system)
	THEN go to add Car Details
ELSE IF (View all Car Details)
	THEN go to the View all Car Details
ELSE IF (View Latest Car Details)
	THEN go to the View Latest Car Details
ELSE IF (Delete Last car Details)
	THEN go to the Delete Last car Details
ELSE IF (Delete First car Details)
	THEN go to the Delete First car Details
ELSE IF (View Desire car details and Buy)
	THEN go to the Buy a Car
		add desire car Model
		Display Details of desire car
			IF (a car need to buy)
				THEN Continue Purchase
			ELSE
				Go to exit
			ENDIF
ELSE
	Exit from the system
END IF
END
```
